# Chasing Cyclones  <img src='https://21centuryweather.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Hackathon-Image-WCRP-Positive-1536x736.jpg' align="right" height="139" />

It is hypothesised that increasing the resolution and thereby explicitly simulating processes that occur on the km-scale will improve the simulation of synoptic-scale vortices such as tropical cyclones and mid-latitude scales. How these weather systems are simulated and whether there are actually improvements is still relatively unknown. Additionally, increased resolution poses challenges for the identification and tracking of these weather systems, with algorithms having to deal fields with tigheter gradients and more noise. This project will use the km-scale simulations to test the current suite identification and tracking tools available and understand how these weather systems are simulated on the km-scale.

The focus of this project will be on cyclonic features such as tropical cyclones, mid-latitude cyclones, and cut-off lows. However, we welcome contributions on a variety of different synoptic scale weather features.

### Required tools ###

**TempestExtremes (/g/data/gb02/tempestextremes)**: The main tool used for tracking and identification of weather systems will be TempestExtremes (TE). TE has been used by various people in the Centre. Chnehui Jin (Monash) has compiled a version on gb02 for use. More information on the tool can be found at https://climate.ucdavis.edu/tempestextremes.php.
